# Design patterns samples

## Last update
- 2023-05-18 - Added the `Behavioral` folder with the `Chain of Responsibility` pattern. *Pending*: add all UML diagrams and README for explain the samples.

## About this repo
This repository contains samples of design patterns in C#. Use for learning purposes.

## What is a design pattern?

A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 

It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

By using a pattern, you can avoid reinventing the wheel every time you run into a common problem and communication better the solution with your team.

There are three types of design patterns:

- **Creational patterns**: these patterns are all about class instantiation. 
- **Structural patterns**: these patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.
- **Behavioral patterns**: these patterns are all about class's objects communication. Behavioral patterns are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between objects.

## How to use this repo

Each pattern is in a separate folder. The folder contains a `README.md` file with a description of the pattern and a sample of the pattern in C#.

- The creational patterns are in the `Creational` folder.
- The structural patterns are in the `Structural` folder.
- The behavioral patterns are in the `Behavioral` folder.

Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022 and run the specific project that you want understand.

## Tips for learning design patterns

All concepts about desing pattern is about the main techniques and principles of object-oriented design. If you want to learn design patterns, you need to know the following concepts:

- **Abstraction**: the process of hiding the internal details and showing only the functionality.
- **Encapsulation**: the process of binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.
- **Inheritance**: the process of creating new classes from existing classes.
- **Polymorphism**: the ability of an object to take on many forms.

SOLID principles are also important to learn design patterns, because some patterns are based on these principles.
